# Computer Vision for Elderly Activity Recognition and Fall Detection

An interactive, graduate-level tutorial website exploring computer vision technologies for elderly care, focusing on activity recognition and fall detection systems.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This tutorial is designed for graduate students with basic knowledge of computer vision and AI. It provides a comprehensive, interactive learning experience covering:

- Sensors and vision approaches (RGB, depth, infrared, pose estimation)
- Activity recognition techniques (CNN, RNN, GCN, anomaly detection, XAI)
- Fall detection systems and their real-world applications
- Challenges in deployment (privacy, bias, computational cost, occlusion)
- Future directions in elderly care technology
